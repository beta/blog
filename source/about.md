My name is **Beta Kuang**, and this is a blog about programming, games and anything that I would like to share. Currently I am working as a web developer at [Meican](https://meican.com) writing servers in Go. I used to work at Ericsson as a C++ radio software developer. I also play with Java (Android apps), Dart and Python.
