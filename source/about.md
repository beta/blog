My name is **Beta Kuang**, and this is a blog about programming, games and anything that I would like to share. 

I am a web developer and I write web servers in Go for food. I also play with Java (Android apps), Dart and Python. I am interested in creating elegant apps for both desktop and mobile.

I listen to all kinds of music while programming, and my favorites are Anisong, J-pop and EDM.

In my spare time, I am an anime lover as well as a video game player especially enjoying ARPG games. You can check out my gaming profiles linked below and you are very welcome to play with me.
